It is a gene that makes a protein found on the surface of all breast cells. It is involved in normal cell growth.</p><p>Genes are the basic units of heredity, passed down from your mother and father. In certain 
   cancers , especially 
   breast cancer , the HER2 gene mutates (changes) and makes extra copies of the gene. When this happens, the HER2 gene makes too much HER2 protein, causing cells to divide and grow too fast.</p><p>Cancers with high levels of the HER2 protein are known as HER2-positive. Cancers with low levels of the protein are known as HER2-negative. About 20 percent of breast cancers are HER2-positive. HER2 positive cancers tend to grow and spread faster than other types of breast cancer. But treatments that specifically target HER2-positive breast cancer can be very effective.</p><p>HER2 testing looks at a sample of tumor tissue to find out whether you have HER2-positive breast cancer.</p><p>Other names: human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, ERBB2 amplification, HER2 overexpression, HER2/neu tests</p></div></div></div></div></li><li class="accordion-item" data-accordion-item=""><a href="#" class="accordion-title"><div class="field-wrapper field field-paragraph--field-label field-name-field-label field-type-string field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item">What is it used for?</div></div></div></a><div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content=""><div class="field-wrapper field field-paragraph--field-body field-name-field-body field-type-text-long field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item"><p>HER2 testing is mostly used to find out whether cancer is HER2-positive.

   biopsy . There are three main types of biopsy procedures:</p><ul><li><strong>Fine needle aspiration biopsy,</strong> which uses a very thin needle to remove a sample of breast cells or fluid</li><li><strong>Core needle biopsy,</strong> which uses a larger needle to remove a sample</li><li><strong>Surgical biopsy,</strong> which removes a sample in a minor, outpatient procedure</li></ul><p><strong>Fine needle aspiration and core needle biopsies</strong> usually include the following steps:</p><ul><li>You will lay on your side or sit on an exam table.</li><li>A health care provider will clean the biopsy site and inject it with an anesthetic so you won't feel any pain during the procedure.</li><li>Once the area is numb, the provider will insert either a fine aspiration needle or core biopsy needle into the biopsy site and remove a sample of tissue or fluid.</li><li>You may feel a little pressure when the sample is withdrawn.</li><li>Pressure will be applied to the biopsy site until the bleeding stops.</li><li>Your provider will apply a sterile bandage at the biopsy site.</li></ul><p><strong>In a surgical biopsy,</strong> a surgeon will make a small cut in your skin to remove all or part of a breast lump. A surgical biopsy is sometimes done if the lump can't be reached with a needle biopsy. Surgical biopsies usually include the following steps.</p><ul><li>You will lie on an operating table. An IV (intravenous line) may be placed in your arm or hand.</li><li>You may be given medicine, called a sedative, to help you relax.</li><li>You will be given local or general 
   anesthesia  so you won't feel pain during the procedure.<ul><li>For local anesthesia, a health care provider will inject the biopsy site with medicine to numb the area.</li><li>For general anesthesia, a specialist called an anesthesiologist will give you medicine so you will be unconscious during the procedure.</li></ul></li><li>Once the biopsy area is numb or you are unconscious, the surgeon will make a small cut into the breast and remove part or all of a lump. Some tissue around the lump may also be removed.</li><li>The cut in your skin will be closed with stitches or adhesive strips.</li></ul><p>The type of biopsy you have will depend on different factors, including the size and location of the tumor. HER2 can also be measured in a blood test, but blood testing for HER2 has not been proven to be useful for most patients. So it is not usually recommended.</p><p>After your tissue sample has been taken, it will be tested in one of two ways:</p><ul><li>Immunohistochemistry (IHC) testing, which measures the HER2 protein on the surface of the cells</li><li>Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) testing, which looks for extra copies of the HER2 gene</li></ul><p>Both types of tests can tell whether you have HER2-positive cancer.</p></div></div></div></div></li><li class="accordion-item" data-accordion-item=""><a href="#" class="accordion-title"><div class="field-wrapper field field-paragraph--field-label field-name-field-label field-type-string field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item">Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?</div></div></div></a><div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content=""><div class="field-wrapper field field-paragraph--field-body field-name-field-body field-type-text-long field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item"><p>You won't need any special preparations if you are getting local anesthesia (numbing of the biopsy site).

Most often, IHC (testing for the HER2 protein) is done first, followed by FISH (testing for extra copies of the gene). IHC testing is less expensive and provides faster results than FISH. But most breast specialists think FISH testing is more accurate.</p><p>Treatments for HER2-positive breast cancer can substantially shrink cancerous tumors, with very few side effects. These treatments are not effective in HER2-negative cancers.</p><p>If you are being treated for HER2-positive cancer, normal results may mean you are responding to treatment.
