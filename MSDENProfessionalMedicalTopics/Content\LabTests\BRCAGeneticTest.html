Genes are parts of DNA passed down from your mother and father. They carry information that determine your unique traits, such as height and eye color. Genes are also responsible for certain health conditions. BRCA1 and BRCA2 are genes that protect cells by making proteins that help prevent tumors from forming.</p><p>A mutation in a BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene can cause cell damage that may lead to 
   cancer .  Women with a mutated BRCA gene have a higher risk of getting 
   breast  or 
   ovarian cancer . Men with a mutated BRCA gene are at a higher risk for getting 
   breast  or 
   prostate cancer . Not everyone who inherits a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation will get cancer. Other factors, including your lifestyle and environment, can affect your cancer risk.</p><p>If you find out you have a BRCA mutation, you may be able to take steps to protect your health.</p><p>Other names: BRCA gene test, BRCA gene 1, BRCA gene 2, breast cancer susceptibility gene1, breast cancer susceptibility gene 2</p></div></div></div></div></li><li class="accordion-item" data-accordion-item=""><a href="#" class="accordion-title"><div class="field-wrapper field field-paragraph--field-label field-name-field-label field-type-string field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item">What is it used for?</div></div></div></a><div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content=""><div class="field-wrapper field field-paragraph--field-body field-name-field-body field-type-text-long field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item"><p>This test is used to find out if you have BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation.

BRCA gene mutations are rare, affecting only about 0.2 percent of the U.S. population. But you may want this test if you think you are at a higher risk of having the mutation. You are more likely to have a BRCA mutation if you:</p><ul><li>Have or had breast cancer that was diagnosed before age 50</li><li>Have or had breast cancer in both breasts</li><li>Have or had both breast and ovarian cancer</li><li>Have one or more family members with breast cancer</li><li>Have a male relative with breast cancer</li><li>Have a relative already diagnosed with a BRCA mutation</li><li>Are of Ashkenazi (Eastern European) Jewish ancestry.

BRCA mutations are also more common in people from other parts of Europe, including, Iceland, Norway, and Denmark.</li></ul><p>If you are in one of these high-risk groups, you may want to consider an at-home test kit for BRCA mutations. The test checks for the three most common BRCA mutations. But there are more than 1000 BRCA mutations, so a negative result may not rule out an increased risk of cancer. </p><p>The at-home tests are not a replacement for an evaluation by a health care provider, but they may be helpful if you don't have easy access to genetic screening.

   birth control pills  for a limited time. Taking birth control pills for a maximum of five years has been shown to reduce the risk of ovarian cancer in some women with  BRCA gene mutations. Taking the pills for more than five years to reduce cancer is not recommended. If you were taking birth control pills before you took the BRCA test, tell your health care provider how old you were when you started taking the pills and for how long.

   mastectomy , to remove healthy breast tissue. Preventive mastectomy has been shown to reduce breast cancer risk by as much as 90 percent in women with a BRCA gene mutation.
