   mosquitos . It can also spread through sex with an infected person or from a pregnant woman to her baby.  A Zika virus test looks for signs of the infection in blood or urine.</p><p>Mosquitos that carry the 
   Zika virus  are most common in areas of the world with tropical climates. These include islands in the Caribbean and the Pacific, and parts of Africa, Central America, South America, and Mexico. In 2016 and 2017, mosquitos carrying the Zika virus were found in parts of the United States, including South Florida. There have not been any reports of Zika virus transmission by mosquitos in the continental United States in the past two years. The last known U.S. case occurred in 2017.</p><p>Most people infected with Zika have no symptoms or mild symptoms that last a few days to a week. But a Zika infection can cause serious complications if you are 
   pregnant . A Zika infection during pregnancy can cause a 
   birth defect  called microcephaly. Microcephaly can severely affect the development of a baby's brain. Zika infections during pregnancy have also been linked to an increased risk of other birth defects, 
   miscarriage , and 
   stillbirth .</p><p>In rare cases, children and adults infected with Zika may get a disease called 
   Guillain-Barré syndrome  (GBS). GBS is a disorder that causes the body's 
   immune system  to attack part of the nervous system. GBS is serious, but treatable. If you get GBS, you will probably recover within a few weeks.</p><p>Other names: Zika Antibody Test, Zika RT-PCR Test , Zika test</p></div></div></div></div></li><li class="accordion-item" data-accordion-item=""><a href="#" class="accordion-title"><div class="field-wrapper field field-paragraph--field-label field-name-field-label field-type-string field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item">What is it used for?</div></div></div></a><div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content=""><div class="field-wrapper field field-paragraph--field-body field-name-field-body field-type-text-long field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item"><p>A Zika virus test is used to find out if you have a Zika infection.

After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.</p><p>If you are getting a Zika test in urine, ask your health care provider for instructions on how to provide your sample.</p><p>If you are pregnant and your 
   prenatal  ultrasound shows the possibility of microcephaly, your health care provider may recommend a procedure called 
   amniocentesis  to check for Zika. Amniocentesis is a test that looks at the fluid that surrounds an unborn baby (amniotic fluid). For this test, your provider will insert a special hollow needle into your belly and withdraw a small sample of fluid for testing.</p></div></div></div></div></li><li class="accordion-item" data-accordion-item=""><a href="#" class="accordion-title"><div class="field-wrapper field field-paragraph--field-label field-name-field-label field-type-string field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item">Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?</div></div></div></a><div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content=""><div class="field-wrapper field field-paragraph--field-body field-name-field-body field-type-text-long field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item"><p>You don't any special preparations for a Zika virus test.</p></div></div></div></div></li><li class="accordion-item" data-accordion-item=""><a href="#" class="accordion-title"><div class="field-wrapper field field-paragraph--field-label field-name-field-label field-type-string field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item">Are there any risks to the test?</div></div></div></a><div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content=""><div class="field-wrapper field field-paragraph--field-body field-name-field-body field-type-text-long field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item"><p>There is very little risk to having a blood test.

While not all babies exposed to Zika have birth defects or any health problems, many children born with Zika have long-lasting special needs. Talk to your health care provider about how to get support and health care services should you need them. Early intervention may make a difference in your child's health and quality of life.</p><p>If you are diagnosed with Zika and are not pregnant, but would like become pregnant in the future, talk to your health care provider. Currently, there is no evidence of Zika-related pregnancy complications in women who have fully recovered from Zika. Your provider can tell you how long you should wait before trying to have a baby and if you need to retested.</p><p>Learn more about
