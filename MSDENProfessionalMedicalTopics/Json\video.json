Among the various maneuvers used to try and achieve vaginal delivery, McRoberts maneuver is often the 1st. Try to deliver the shoulder while assistants hyperflex and slightly abduct the hips. An assistant should also apply suprapubic pressure in the direction of the fetal head.  Apply pressure to the suprapubic area. Do NOT apply pressure to the uterine fundus, as shown here. Fundal pressure tends to increase impaction of the shoulder against the pubic bone and increases risk of fetal injury. If delivery is unsuccessful, assess whether the vaginal opening is wide enough to accommodate your hand for additional maneuvers. If not, consider episiotomy so that these maneuvers can be done. The 1st such maneuver is usually a rotational maneuver to try to dislodge the shoulder. Rotate the anterior or posterior shoulder toward the face of the fetus.  Another option is delivery of the posterior arm, as shown here. This requires inserting your entire hand into the vagina. To do this, hold your hand with your thumb tucked in, as when putting a bracelet on. Do NOT hold your hand with the thumb away from the fingers, as shown here. This common mistake will make it difficult or impossible to insert the entire hand into the vagina. With your hand in the vagina, grab the wrist, flex the elbow, and move the entire arm up and over the head. If rotational maneuvers and delivery of the arm are ineffective or can’t be done, position the mother on her hands and knees for delivery. This is called the Gaskin maneuver. If all attempts have been unsuccessful and more than 4 or 5 min have elapsed since delivery of the head, consider putting the fetus back into the abdomen and doing an immediate cesarean delivery. Drugs that decrease contractions, such as terbutaline, may be helpful.","MediaUrl":null,"Semantics":null,"MerckEdition":null,"LastUpdatedDate":null,"ReferencedInVasontLanguages":null,"Language":null,"RelatedTopicId":"{817000D3-5899-4CE9-9F55-FDD8B19CB5F7}","RelatedTopicName":"Shoulder Dystocia","Citation":"<span id=\"v25576325\" class=\"anchor\" ></span><div class=\"para\" > <p >Procedure by Kate Leonard, MD, and Will Stone, MD, Walter Reed National Military Medical Center Residency in Obstetrics and Gynecology; and Shad Deering, COL, MD, Chair, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Uniformed Services University.

and Metabolic Disorders","Name":"Overview of Physiologic pH and Buffers","Credits":null,"VasontCaption":null,"VasontDescription":"Physiologic pH is a way of quantifying the balance between acids and bases in the body. In fact, the pH depends on the concentration of hydrogen ions and can be described with this equation: pH = −log [H+]. The cells and enzymes in our tissues and organs work best when the concentration of hydrogen ions is 40 x 10^-9 Eq/L, or 40 nEq/L. Small changes to that number matter a lot, and because it can get annoying working with such small numbers, scientists converted this concentration into a logarithmic function and expressed it as pH. In this case, a hydrogen ion concentration of 40 x 10^-9 Eq/L, works out to a pH of 7.4. Now, there are two important aspects to remember when using this logarithmic function. First, as hydrogen concentrations increase, the pH decreases, because of the negative sign in front of the log. Second, since it’s a logarithmic function, pH and the hydrogen ion concentration don’t have a linear relationship. For example, an increase in pH from 7.4 to 7.6 means a decrease in the hydrogen concentration of 15 nEq/L. Whereas a decrease in pH from 7.4 to 7.2 means an increase in the hydrogen concentration of 23 nEq/L. That’s why the graph of hydrogen ion concentration versus pH has a curve to it, rather than being a straight line. For simplicity sake, when the body’s pH drops below 7.4 it’s considered acidemia, and when it goes above 7.4, it’s considered alkalemia. Due to this logarithmic relationship, a change in pH in the acidic range, pH  7.4. Maintaining a pH between 7.37 and 7.42 is essential for the human body. This is accomplished with buffers. In everyday language a \"buffer,\" is something that acts like a protective cushion or shield, and the same is true of physiologic buffers - they shield the pH from rising or falling too quickly. The reason the body needs buffers is that acids - or molecules that readily give up their hydrogen ion - are being generated by the body all the time. These extra hydrogen ions would shift the pH into the acidic zone, so the body needs a way to handle these without having a major shift in the overall pH. To accomplish this, buffers can essentially take on some of these extra hydrogen ions, and therefore keep the pH from dropping too much. buffers are usually a weak acid with its conjugate base form, or a weak base with its conjugate acid form. The most important buffer in the body is the weak acid carbonic acid H2CO3 and its conjugate base, bicarbonate ion HCO3-. Carbonic acid forms when carbon dioxide combines with water, with the help of the enzyme carbonic anhydrase. As a weak acid, carbonic acid H2CO3 easily dissociates into hydrogen H+ ions and bicarbonate ions HCO3-. Of course, these reactions are reversible, and can happen in the opposite direction as well. In fact, because carbonic acid is such a weak acid, when hydrogen ion concentration gets low, it will drop off it’s hydrogen ion and the equation moves to the right, producing more bicarbonate and a hydrogen ion, and when there are lots of hydrogen ions around, the bicarbonate will bind to one and form carbonic acid, which can go the other way and split into water and carbon dioxide. And the carbon dioxide can be breathed out through the lungs.  So, imagine you’ve got some extracellular fluid, and it has a normal amount of H+ ions that puts it in the normal physiologic pH range. Now we drop some NaOH in, or sodium hydroxide, which is a strong base. That means that in water, it completely dissociates into sodium Na+ ions and hydroxide OH- ions. The hydroxide OH- ions bind to hydrogen H+ ions, forming water, making the fluid more basic, since there’s a decrease in hydrogen H+ ions, which increases the pH a lot. But when there’s plenty of CO2 around, it reacts with the water to form more H2CO3 carbonic acid, which splits into bicarbonate ions and hydrogen ions, rapidly replacing the hydrogen H+ ions, and buffering the pH and keeping it in a normal range.  On the flip side, imagine tossing HCl into the fluid. Hydrochloric acid is a strong acid and would fully dissociate into hydrogen H+ ions and a bunch of chloride Cl- ions. Without a buffer this would cause it to become acidic, since there’s more H+, and therefore the pH would go down. The new hydrogen H+ ions, would get instantly grabbed by bicarbonate ions HCO3- and converted to H2CO3 carbonic acid, which would then dissociate into carbon dioxide CO2 and H2O. Once again, this buffer normalizes the pH!  The great thing is that there’s a huge supply of carbonic acid because it’s formed from carbon dioxide CO2 and H2O, which are in abundant supply in the body. Finally, if there’s too much carbon dioxide CO2, it is blown off by the lungs, and if there are too many bicarbonate ions HCO3-, they get eliminated by the kidneys.  Apart from the bicarbonate buffer system, there’s also the phosphate buffer system. Again, that’s a mixture of the weak acid dihydrogen phosphate H2PO4- and its conjugate base monohydrogen phosphate HPO42-. Dihydrogen phosphate has two hydrogens and it’s always ready to give off one of them and get converted to monohydrogen phosphate HPO42- which has a single hydrogen. Now, the extracellular fluid and especially, the plasma, is also full of proteins, like albumin, which serve as another extremely important buffer system. That’s because some of the proteins’ amino acids have exposed carboxyl groups —COOH, that act as weak acids, meaning that they are ready to release hydrogen H+ ions when the pH begins to rise while others have exposed —NH2 amine groups that act as weak bases, meaning that they can bind a hydrogen ion, preventing it from decreasing the pH. In other words, a single protein molecule can function both as an acid as well as a base depending on the pH it has to deal with. But, unlike the bicarbonate buffering system, there are only a limited number of proteins in our plasma, which limits how much they can buffer.  Alright, until now we’ve explored the extracellular fluid, but intracellular pH has to stay balanced as well, and this is the pH inside cells. Cells are full of proteins, and they’re the most significant intracellular buffer. An example is hemoglobin within red blood cells. Hemoglobin can reversibly bind either hydrogen ions H+, which binds to the protein itself, or O2 which binds to the iron of the heme group, and the interesting thing is that when one of these is bound, the other is released. So when red blood cells are in capillaries of various tissues, the O2 levels are low and CO2 levels are high. The CO2 diffuses into red blood cells, where carbonic anhydrase enzyme combines H2O with CO2 to form carbonic acid, H2CO3, which then dissociates to H+ and HCO3-. Because there’s so much CO2 around, the reaction continues in the direction of generating more H+ and HCO3-, and over time the buildup of hydrogen ions can cause the pH to fall. To prevent the hydrogen ion concentration from rising too quickly, each deoxygenated hemoglobin binds hydrogen ions. The bicarbonate HCO3- on the other hand, moves into the plasma in exchange for chloride Cl- ions. This exchange, called the chloride shift, keeps positive and negative charges balanced.  Now, once the red blood cell gets into the capillaries of the lungs, there’s a low level of carbon dioxide and high level of O2, so the process reverses. Oxygen binds to hemoglobin, and hydrogen ions H+ get released. Bicarbonate reenters the red blood cell and combines with the hydrogen ions to form carbonic acid, which dissociates into H2O and CO2, and the CO2 gets breathed out by the lungs.  Intracellular fluid also has large amounts of organic phosphates, like ATP and glucose-6-phosphate which can serve as intracellular buffers. The phosphate group of these organic molecules can serve as a source or sink for excess hydrogen H+ ions.  All right, as a quick recap, between 7.37 and 7.42 is physiologic pH. The body uses buffering systems to maintain pH within this range. Buffers are pairs of a weak acid and its conjugate base or a weak base and its conjugate acid and their physiologic role in our body is to resist pH changes. The most important buffers in the extracellular fluid, are bicarbonate, phosphate, and plasma proteins, and the most important buffers within cells are proteins like hemoglobin, and organic phosphates, like ATP.","MediaUrl":null,"Semantics":null,"MerckEdition":null,"LastUpdatedDate":null,"ReferencedInVasontLanguages":null,"Language":null,"RelatedTopicId":"{A79D465A-F04F-4C1C-93A4-0A79CFFA8752}","RelatedTopicName":"Acid Base Regulation","Citation":"<span id=\"v37917169\" class=\"anchor\" ></span><div class=\"para\" > <p >Physiologic pH and Buffers (Acid-Base Physiology) (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EnIPG3WRRo&index=9&list=PLY33uf2n4e6PT53f0Z5LmFHo7Vb0ljn5b) by Osmosis (https://open.osmosis.org/) is licensed under CC-BY-SA 4.0 (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).</p></div>","TopicLocations":[{"Title":"Overview of Physiologic pH and Buffers","SitecoreItemId":null,"Type":null,"BrightcoveVideoId":"5721832483001","TopicId":"{A79D465A-F04F-4C1C-93A4-0A79CFFA8752}","TopicName":"Acid Base Regulation","SectionName":"Endocrine and Metabolic Disorders"}]},{"ItemId":"{1F429FA5-CAA3-3BDD-AE98-4DDBF183AAED}","VideoId":"6276912914001","ShortDescription":null,"PlayerId":null,"PlayerKey":null,"ContentType":"Video","Tags":"Nutritional Disorders","Name":"Overview of Proteins","Credits":null,"VasontCaption":null,"VasontDescription":"Protein is an essential part of the human diet. It’s found in a variety of foods like eggs, dairy, seafood, legumes, meats, nuts, and seeds. Regardless of the source, the protein that we eat gets broken down and reformed into new proteins in our bodies. These proteins do everything from fighting infections to helping cells divide. You name it, they’re doing it. At its simplest, a protein is a chain of amino acids, bound to one another by peptide bonds. Like a string of beads. These strings get twisted and folded into a final protein shape. When we eat protein, it gets broken down into its individual amino acids. Most amino acids have a central carbon atom bonded to one amino or nitrogen-containing group and one carboxylic acid group - that’s why it’s called an amino acid. The carbon also has one hydrogen atom and a side chain which is unique to each amino acid. The exception to this is proline which has a tiny little ring structure instead. Although there are hundreds of amino acids in nature, humans use only about 20 of them to make basically every type of protein. They include: alanine, arginine, asparagine, aspartic acid, cysteine, glutamic acid, glutamine, glycine, histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, proline, serine, threonine, tryptophan, tyrosine, and valine. Phew, that’s 20. One way to divide them is by defining which ones our bodies can make ourselves, and which ones we cannot. There are 5 amino acids - alanine, asparagine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, and serine - that we can get from foods, but we can also make ourselves. These are called nonessential amino acids. Then, there are 6 of them that we call conditionally essential because healthy bodies can make them under normal circumstances - arginine, cysteine, glutamine, glycine, proline, and tyrosine. But we can’t make them in cases like starvation or certain inborn errors of metabolism. Finally, there are 9 of them that we can only get from food - histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine. We call these the essential amino acids. Dietary protein provides the essential amino acids that are needed to make our own proteins, hormones, and other important molecules. A circle of life, of sorts. But to do so, we need to break the dietary protein down first, through a process called proteolysis. When we eat a protein-containing food, proteolysis begins when the food reaches the stomach. First, hydrochloric acid denatures the protein, unfolding it and making the amino acid chain more accessible to enzymatic action. Then, pepsin, which is a protein itself made by gastric chief cells, enters the picture. Pepsin cleaves any available protein into smaller oligopeptide chains which move into the duodenum, where a second set of digestive enzymes, made by the pancreas, further chop the oligopeptides into tripeptides, dipeptides, and individual amino acids. These can all be taken up into the intestinal cells, where di- and tripeptides are then converted into amino acids. Some amino acids remain in these cells and are used to synthesize intestinal enzymes and new cells. But most enter the bloodstream and are transported to other parts of the body. In general, animal-based protein foods like eggs, dairy, seafood, and meat provide all nine essential amino acids in adequate amounts. Soy foods are unique in that they are plant-based and also provide all nine essential amino acids in adequate amounts. Most other plant foods, including whole grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds, have high amounts of some amino acids and low amounts of others. Hearing this, it might be easy to assume that animal-based foods provide more protein than plant-based sources, but as it turns out a cup of tofu has the same number of grams of protein as 3 ounces of steak, chicken, or fish, and half a cup of lentils has more grams of protein than an egg! And not all plant foods are low in the same amino acids, so eating a variety of plant-based foods can provide all nine of the essentials. For example, pairing protein sources like rice and beans or hummus and pita bread or oatmeal topped with almond butter. However, in terms of volume, it may be necessary to eat more plant-based foods to get a similar amount of protein and amino acid profile provided by animal-based proteins. Generally speaking, daily protein requirements are based on studies that estimate the minimum amount of protein needed to avoid a progressive nitrogen loss. The World Health Organization guidelines and the US Recommended Dietary Allowance each estimate that daily protein requirements for healthy adults are about 0.80 grams per kilogram of body weight. Protein recommendations per day vary by age, too. Children 1 to 3 years of age are recommended to get 13 grams. For ages 4 to 8, 19 grams are recommended. And between ages 9 and 13, 34 grams are recommended. Whether a person is male or female also impacts protein needs. Females ages 14 and above are recommended to get 46 grams of protein per day. Males ages 14 to 18 need slightly more, about 52 grams per day. And males 19 and older are recommended to get 56 grams per day. Some groups like pregnant and breastfeeding women as well as athletes have elevated needs, and older adults may also benefit from eating more protein. Getting the right amount of protein per day can be achieved in multiple ways. For example, one serving of Greek yogurt with breakfast, a salad topped with 3 ounces of chicken for lunch, and 3 to 4 ounces of fish at dinner provides about 64 grams of protein. Getting the same amount of protein could also be achieved by eating a cup of tofu scramble and a slice of peanut butter toast for breakfast, a cup of shelled edamame with lunch, and one cup each of lentils and brown rice at dinner, which also offers about 64 grams of protein in total.  Now, the fact is that it’s still unclear what an “optimal” amount of protein is and the research is ongoing. In clinical settings, there are certain individuals who may be at risk for a protein deficiency, including patients with malnutrition, trauma and burn injuries, and various conditions impacting nutrient absorption, like inflammatory bowel disease. These individuals may have increased protein needs compared to the general population. Except for certain circumstances like kidney disease, there usually isn’t a health risk associated with eating a lot of protein, because our bodies are able to process it.  Alright, as a quick recap. Protein is a cornerstone of the human diet, and a major component of our bodies. There are 5 nonessential, 6 conditionally essential, and 9 essential amino acids.

This is a familiar position and convenient for the birth attendant, however there are alternative positions that are more effective for birthing women. This video shows a variety of birthing positions to give women choices.  These positions help the normal natural process of birth and support a woman’s pushing efforts. Lying on her back can hinder the woman’s pushing efforts, reduce oxygen to the baby, and slow down the birth. Encourage different positions for giving birth, but if the woman prefers to lie on her back, suggest she raise her head to help her pushing efforts; or, better, help her to raise her upper body. Women who choose other birthing positions may give birth more quickly and easily.  Let’s see some examples.  Here the woman is sitting up in the bed, supported by her partner behind her. This position is comfortable for many women, and makes it easy to see the progress of the birth. Support the perineum as you keep the head flexed, then guide the slow birth of the baby’s head. Once the baby rotates, assist the birth of the shoulders.  In this next example, the woman is lying on her side. This position is restful yet allows contractions to remain strong and powerful. It relaxes the perineum and may help prevent tears. The woman can have her companion help support her leg or she may hold her leg by herself. In a side lying position, as in all other positions, support the perineum as you keep the baby’s head flexed; then let the head slowly birth. As the baby rotates, the shoulders come on their own.  Upright positions, such as squatting, are very effective in bringing the baby down. The uterus often contracts more effectively plus gravity helps the baby move more easily through the pelvis. The pelvic opening also becomes wider in upright positions. Here the midwife keeps her hand on the baby’s head to monitor progress. Just as the head comes, the woman chooses to lie back. A woman’s legs may tire quickly if she’s not used to squatting. Here the woman supports herself with bars that are attached to the birthing bed. The baby’s head slowly emerges, then the top shoulder; and the bottom shoulder. The baby is born. This woman is in a squatting position supported by the back of the bed. With a few effective pushes, the baby is born.  Hands and knees, another upright position, is a favorite position of many women and is helpful when the woman feels her labor in her back. The perineum will often naturally stretch which can prevent tears. The woman cannot see your face – so talk to her often to let her know her progress. Checking the baby’s heart rate is easiest with a doppler or a stethoscope. Wipe away any fecal material that may appear while she’s pushing. Support the perineum and apply light pressure on the back of the baby’s head to keep it flexed. Remember, the birth movements will be the opposite of the way they appear when the woman is on her back. The baby’s face will be looking at the ceiling when it appears. The next contraction brings the baby. Support her as she’s born, then dry her on the blanket at the feet of the mother. Pass the baby through the mother’s legs with her cord intact. The mother then turns over and rests with her baby skin to skin. Keep in mind that the hands and knees position increases the room in the pelvis and is one of the maneuvers to try if a baby’s shoulders are tight.  This woman is pushing very effectively in this half kneeling position. As with the hands and knees position, you’ll need to be behind the woman to catch the baby. After the baby rotates, assist the shoulders to deliver, one and then the other. Encourage women in your care to try different positions. You will gain confidence in your ability to support a woman’s choice in how she’ll give birth. Often she will find the most comfortable position for herself, which is also the one that helps her push most effectively.  Remember, active upright positions help the natural process of birth. Upright positions can help bring the baby out when the birth is slow. Demonstrate and encourage different positions during birth.","MediaUrl":null,"Semantics":null,"MerckEdition":null,"LastUpdatedDate":null,"ReferencedInVasontLanguages":null,"Language":null,"RelatedTopicId":"{57B9A297-9D75-4C05-8DD4-7B600ACF2CF6}","RelatedTopicName":"Management of Spontaneous Vaginal Delivery","Citation":"<span id=\"v88631990\" class=\"anchor\" ></span><div class=\"para\" > <p >Copyright Global Health Media</p></div>","TopicLocations":[{"Title":"Positions for Birth","SitecoreItemId":null,"Type":null,"BrightcoveVideoId":"6191384854001","TopicId":"{57B9A297-9D75-4C05-8DD4-7B600ACF2CF6}","TopicName":"Management of Spontaneous Vaginal Delivery","SectionName":"Gynecology and Obstetrics"}]},{"ItemId":"{0286C2B2-747C-31AA-93DA-A62E417ECB53}","VideoId":"3902008668001","ShortDescription":null,"PlayerId":null,"PlayerKey":null,"ContentType":"Rehab","Tags":"Injuries; Poisoning","Name":"Quadriceps Set","Credits":null,"VasontCaption":null,"VasontDescription":"1.

We use a wide prep to prepare for a right central venous catheter insertion. After the prep dries we will place a wide sterile barrier. The sterile drape should cover the entire lower half of the body including the bed between the patient and the operator. We're now using a sterile sheath to grasp the ultrasound probe that has had a non-sterile ultrasound gel applied to the top. You grasp the ultrasound probe and then carefully pull the sterile sheath over the probe so that you can have a sterile probe to do real time ultrasound.  Now we're going to prepare the catheter. We're applying needleless caps on to the blue port and the white port of the catheter and we're going to use sterile saline to flush each of the ports. Here we're flushing the white and the blue port of the catheter that have the caps in place. And with the brown port which is the distal port the wire will be coming out of that port so we do not have a cap in place but after we flush that port we'll have to clip the line before removing the sterile saline syringe.  Now with the 1 percent lidocaine we're applying a sterile label so that all the syringes can have sterile identification. Sterile ultrasound gel is then use on the skin and now we're looking at the right femoral artery and the femoral vein in transverse orientation. The femoral artery is on the top left-hand side. With compression you can see that the right femoral vein compresses but that the right femoral artery which is more superficial and to the left does not compress. We're using 1 percent lidocaine for local anesthesia of the skin and the underlying soft tissue.  Now we're introducing a introducer needle at about a 45 degree angle inserted the same depth away from the probe as the vein is deep to the probe. We are inserting so that we gradually can see the needle advance into the vein and now we have return of venous blood. We're going to grasp the hub of the needle and withdraw the syringe to confirm that it is nonpulsatile blood. Now we're going to insert the sterile wire through the sheath and through the needle. We are going to rotate the probe into the longitudinal orientation and we can see that the wire is threading into the vein as the wire is advanced through the needle.  In the femoral location the wire can be advanced even as deep as 30 centimeters. Now the sheath is removed and the wire is left in place. It is important to never let go of the wire as it can embolize and travel through the vein. The needle is now withdrawn and leaving the wire in place you can still see that the wire is in the vein on the ultrasound image. And now the probe can be dropped and sterile gauze can be used to identify the insertion site clearly, and then a scalpel could be used to nick the skin over the wire. Now a dilator is inserted over the wire and the wire is grasped on the opposite side of the dilator. The dilator is advanced with a twisting motion to dilate a tract through the subcutaneous tissue and into the femoral vein.  Now the dilator is withdrawn leaving the wire in place. The wire is then threaded back through the central venous catheter until you can grasp the wire on the opposite end of the brown or distal port of the catheter. Now the wire is grasped on the distal end of the catheter and then the catheter is advanced all the way to the end of the catheter. And now the wire is withdrawn back into its sterile sheath and completely withdrawn out of the body. Once the wire is completely withdrawn the brown port is clipped.  Now we're introducing the last needleless cap onto the brown port and then it will be unclipped and then you will withdraw the blood into the syringe and then the whole line is flushed, care being taken not to inject any air into the port. Now the white and the blue ports of the central venous catheter are flushed with sterile saline. Now some local anesthesia is used to numb up the skin adjacent to the central venous catheter, a bio-patch is applied at the insertion site with the blue side angled towards the ceiling. This is a patch that's impregnated with chlorhexidine to minimize the risk of catheter related bloodstream infections.  And now suture is used to secure the catheter in place in two locations. After this is secured, a sterile occlusive dressing will be applied over the central line to complete the procedure. Here an instrument tie is being used to secure the central line using suture which is done in two locations.","MediaUrl":null,"Semantics":null,"MerckEdition":null,"LastUpdatedDate":null,"ReferencedInVasontLanguages":null,"Language":null,"RelatedTopicId":"{A47C72B6-1965-49F1-AD72-8713498439AB}","RelatedTopicName":"Vascular Access","Citation":"<span id=\"v48802994\" class=\"anchor\" ></span><div class=\"para\" > <p >Video created by Hospital Procedures Consultants at www.hospitalprocedures.org.</p></div>","TopicLocations":[{"Title":"Ultrasound-Guided Cannulation of the Femoral Vein","SitecoreItemId":null,"Type":null,"BrightcoveVideoId":"4888683153001","TopicId":"{A47C72B6-1965-49F1-AD72-8713498439AB}","TopicName":"Vascular Access","SectionName":"Critical Care Medicine"},{"Title":"Ultrasound-Guided Cannulation of the Femoral Vein","SitecoreItemId":null,"Type":null,"BrightcoveVideoId":"4888683153001","TopicId":"{56D2691E-4E88-4E72-983C-55FEB10C470C}","TopicName":"How To Do Femoral Vein Cannulation, Ultrasound Guided","SectionName":"Critical Care Medicine"}]},{"ItemId":"{1EA189BD-3B4C-392F-85D8-69E6DFE48E9D}","VideoId":"6191419594001","ShortDescription":null,"PlayerId":null,"PlayerKey":null,"ContentType":"Procedure","Tags":"Gynecology and Obstetrics","Name":"Uterine Balloon Tamponade","Credits":null,"VasontCaption":null,"VasontDescription":"A uterine balloon tamponade is a simple device made from common, low-cost materials that can stop post-partum hemorrhage due to a relaxed uterus. It’s inserted inside the uterus, filled with fluid and works by compressing the bleeding vessels. This video will show how to use a uterine balloon tamponade for postpartum hemorrhage.  This woman is bleeding heavily. Her uterus is not contracting even though you have massaged it, given her medicine to contract her uterus, and done bimanual compression. Tell the woman what you need to do and why. Ask for her consent. Then place a urinary catheter into her bladder. Do aortic compression as you prepare and insert a uterine balloon tamponade.  Have your supplies ready in a kit: a urinary catheter, sterile gloves, a condom, sterile string, a 60 milliliter syringe, an IV giving set, and a 500 milliliter bag of IV fluid. You will also need a ring forceps, and a sims speculum. Wash your hands and put on sterile gloves. Place the condom over the catheter. Then tie a string tightly around the end of the condom.  Let’s see that again close up: unroll the condom over the catheter until the condom is completely unrolled. Then, with a length of sterile string, securely tie the end of the condom. Place the speculum to visualize the cervix. Then insert the catheter with the condom through the cervix and high into the uterus. Some birth attendants use 2 condoms for extra security.  Connect the catheter to the IV giving set and run in 300 to 500 milliliters of IV fluid. As the condom fills with water it presses against the inside of the uterus where the bleeding is coming from. The pressure stops the bleeding. Inflate the condom until it is visible at the cervix. Now ‒ fold the catheter and clamp it to keep the fluid inside. Record how much fluid you have used, and the insertion time.  Mark the level of the uterine fundus. Monitor if the fundus rises beyond the mark. This is a sign of hidden bleeding. If bleeding is not controlled 15 minutes after inserting the balloon tamponade, keep the device in place and transport the woman for surgical care immediately. If bleeding is controlled, give oxytocin 20 units in 1 liter of IV fluid at 60 drops per minute. Also give the woman a single dose of antibiotics to prevent infection ‒ either 2 grams of ampicillin IV OR 1 gram of cefazolin IV.  Closely monitor the woman’s bleeding, her fundal height, and vital signs. After 6 hours and up to 24 hours, if the woman is stable – with no vaginal bleeding and her fundal height is at the same level – start to slowly remove the fluid from the balloon. Remove 200 milliliters every hour. If her bleeding starts again, refill the balloon. If there is no further vaginal bleeding 30 minutes after the balloon is flat, remove the balloon. Continue to monitor the woman for the next 6 hours.  Remember, have your supplies ready in a balloon tamponade kit. As the condom fills with water, it presses against the inside of the uterus and stops the bleeding. After 6 hours and up to 24 hours, if the woman is stable, begin to slowly remove the fluid.","MediaUrl":null,"Semantics":null,"MerckEdition":null,"LastUpdatedDate":null,"ReferencedInVasontLanguages":null,"Language":null,"RelatedTopicId":"{76A26B7F-0134-46E5-A864-F720EEE21FBB}","RelatedTopicName":"Postpartum Hemorrhage","Citation":"<span id=\"v50024250\" class=\"anchor\" ></span><div class=\"para\" > <p >Copyright Global Health Media</p></div>","TopicLocations":[{"Title":"Uterine Balloon Tamponade","SitecoreItemId":null,"Type":null,"BrightcoveVideoId":"6191419594001","TopicId":"{76A26B7F-0134-46E5-A864-F720EEE21FBB}","TopicName":"Postpartum Hemorrhage","SectionName":"Gynecology and Obstetrics"}]},{"ItemId":"{20FD0C8C-CBD4-3863-8263-7D257F783253}","VideoId":"3902008720001","ShortDescription":null,"PlayerId":null,"PlayerKey":null,"ContentType":"Rehab","Tags":"Injuries; Poisoning","Name":"Wrist Flexor Stretch","Credits":null,"VasontCaption":null,"VasontDescription":"1.
